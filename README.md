# KoopKorobilis2010

A Julia port of the MATLAB code for Gary Koop and Dimitris Korobilis (2010), "Bayesian Multivariate Time Series Methods for Empirical Macroeconomics", *Foundations and Trends in Econometrics*: Vol. 3: No. 4, pp 267-358, [http://dx.doi.org/10.1561/0800000013](@refhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1561/0800000013).

The code has only been edited enough to make it run in Julia; it has not been optimized for Julia and I've made as little use of external packages as possible.
